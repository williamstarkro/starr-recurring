* Upon server instantiation, the process currently builds and deploys contracts. Please be sure to update `GANACHE_HOST` and `GANACHE_PORT` the environment variables file `.env` file when you are running a new local instance of Ganache.

## Environment variables Explanation

* **GANACHE_HOST** - Host IP address of local Ganache instance
* **GANACHE_PORT**  - Local Ganache port

## Quickstart Guide

The following script will build and deploy all contracts to the testing environment.

```
./dev.sh
```

### Flow of dev.sh

1. Checks to make sure that all prerequisite applications are present and exits if any are missing
2. Checks for script parameters in run to see `-s` to see if initial setup is required. If required, environment files will be generated, node modules will be installed, and migrations will be generated.
3. Starts up ganache environment
4. Builds and deploys contracts to the local testing environment
